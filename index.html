            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <h2>My family</h2>
                    <p>My lovely family consists of two beautiful human 
                    beings. My 2-year-old boy is a bundle of energy 
                    and curiosity, brightening every day with his 
                    playful spirit and endless discoveries. As well as 
                    my handsome husband who loves and supports everything 
                    we do.</p>
                <h2>My Naval Career</h2>
                    <p>I joined the navy when I was 17 years old and I've 
                    now been employed by defence as an electronics 
                    technician for 10 years. The navy has granted me 
                    many opportunities and experiences that . I was fortunate enough 
                    to travel to many different countries and make friends 
                    with amazing people from all over the world. The 
                    highlight of my career was firing two missiles and 
                    leading an excellent team conducting maintenance on two 
                    advanced RADARs. Here is some pictures that I've 
                    collected along the way.</p>

                <h2>Why I am changing career</h2>
                    <p>Now that I have a little family, I can't see myself 
                    going away for 9 months of the year anymore. I don't 
                    see it as being sustainable for my young family 
                    while we continue to expand our family.</p>
                <h2>My Interests and hobbies</h2>
                    <p>My interests and hobbies consist of playing onward 
                    in VR and many other games on the PC and PS. I also 
                    love sports, my favourite are softball and soccer. 
                    Unfortunately due to the nature of my work I don't 
                    have a lot of time to participate sports</p>
