            <h2>My Naval Career</h2>
                <p>I joined the navy when I was 17 years old and I've 
                    now been employed by defence as an electronics 
                    technician for 10 years. The navy has granted me 
                    many opportunities and experiences that I believe has 
                    developed me as a person. I was fortunate enough 
                    to travel to many different countries and make friends 
                    with amazing people from all over the world. The 
                    highlight of my career was firing two missiles and 
                    leading an excellent team conducting maintenance on two 
                    advanced RADARs. Here is some pictures that I've 
                    collected along the way.
