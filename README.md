## Description
    My GitHub portfolio opens with warm greetings, setting a friendly and professional tone. The "Capabilities" section highlights my expertise in web development. The "Projects" section is still under construction due to not having any completed projects to showcase. The "About Me" section offers a personal touch, sharing my journey and aspirations. Additionally, there are convenient links for anyone wishing to contact me in the greetings area of the page, facilitating easy communication for collaborations or inquiries.

## Road Map
    Future updates will consist of:
    Updating Share icon link once I understand Javascript
    Adding completed "Projects" from this course
    Adding a "Future Projects" part into the "Projects" section 
    Updating "Capabilites" section throughout the course showcasing both front-end and back-end skills
    Fix flaws with responsive activity
